 # Showrooms easy to generate from data of a construction drawing or dimensional sketch. 


You will find a whole range of tools for displaying buildings and rooms along with their furnishings. Among them are both firmly defined and interactive ones.

In this case, the basis for the design of flexibly configurable rooms is a construction drawing or a simple dimensional sketch.

The data is written in compact form in a simple text file (.js) according to a given scheme. For optional values you can define the defaults yourself. After each new entry you can see the result immediately after updating the page. So you can react immediately in case of an incorrect entry.

On the other hand you can simply put two slashes // in front of a line and remove elements temporarily.

The compact form of the data initially requires increased concentration during input. After a little bit of practice you can quickly play through different scenarios.

By specifying less data, lighting, mirrors and 3D models are also integrated.
With the definition of colors and the assignment of materials and multi-materials, the rooms can be designed individually.
